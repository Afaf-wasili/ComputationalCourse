This is Gussian equation with plot:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution

Efficiency:signal(cut)/total(siganl(cut)+signal(no cut))

Efficincy_error: np.sqrt(efficiency * (1 - efficiency) / total(siganl(cut)+signal(no cut))

Purity:signal(cut)/total(siganl(cuts) + background(cuts)
purity
