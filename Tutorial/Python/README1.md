Outline:

Variables and Types: Variables-Types.py

Normal Operators, Logical operators: or, and, not: Logical-Operators.py

Conditional Statements: (if, if-else, if-elif-else): Statements.py

Examples on Logical operators: or, and, not can be understanding very well till knowing the conditional statements

Iterative Computation (looping):The for and while loop: While is looking for the index and for is lookingfor the first exact nymber does not matter the index just define the specific number then it will start with. If we are dealing with range(start,end) instead of i in range(len(n)), the n[i] is not needed only use i: Looping.py

The break and Continue statement: Breakcontinue.py

Library: Library.py

Methods: Methods.py

Functions and Value returning Functions: Functions.py, Return-Main-Function.py

Data File handling: read text file: Textread.py

Class: many functions: Class.py

Plotting: Library: mathplotlib(plotting in python, cann't read root file), ROOT(read, write, plotting in python, running: python3 ....py), uproot(read root file  and then using matplotlib for plotting): path: /Users/afafwasili/ComputationalMC/Tutorial/PythonROOTMat
