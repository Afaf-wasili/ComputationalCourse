#Operators are special symbols which represents computation. They are applied on operand(s), which can be values or variables. Same operator can behave differently on different data types. Operators when applied on operands form an expression. Operators are categorized as Arithmetic, Assignment, Relational and Logical. Value and variables when used with operator are known as operands.



#Arithmetic Operator:
'''
Operator	Name	Example
+	Addition	x + y
-	Subtraction	x - y
*	Multiplication	x * y
/	Division	x / y
%	Modulus	x % y
**	Exponentiation	x ** y: x^y
//	Floor division	x // y :  // means double division
'''



#Assignment Operators
'''
Operator  Example	Same As
=	   x = 5	x = 5
+=	  x += 3	x = x + 3
-=	  x -= 3	x = x â€“ 3
*=	  x *= 3	x = x * 3
/=	  x /= 3	x = x / 3
%=	  x %= 3	x = x % 3
//=	  x //= 3	x = x // 3
**=	  x **= 3	x = x ** 3
'''


#Relational Operators
'''
Operator  Name	                        Example
==	  Equal	                        x == y
!=	  Not equal	                x != y
> 	  Greater than	                x > y
< 	  Less than	                x < y
>=	  Greater than or equal to	x >= y
<=	  Less than or equal to	        x <= y

'''


#Logical Operator
'''
Operator	Description	Example     
and	Returns True if both statements are true	x < 5 and x < 10
or	Returns True if one of the statements is true	x < 5 or x < 4
not	Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true	not(x < 5 and x < 10)

#Algebraic Expression to Python Statement
#Exerise: Evaluate the Following statement.
'''
x = 3
y = 5
average = x+y/2 
print('average=',average)
'''

#to get more accurate results, () must be involved
x = 3
y = 5
average = ( x + y ) / 2 
print(average)
