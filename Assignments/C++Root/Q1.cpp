/* Using C++ Sytenx
File Handling

1. How would you open the mlpHiggs.root file and retrieve the trees sig_filtered and bg_filtered in C++?

2. Write C++ code to calculate the purity for a given acolinearity threshold.
3. Extend your code to calculate the product of efficiency and purity for each threshold.
Plotting

4. How would you plot the efficiency, purity, and their product in a single graph using ROOT in C++?
Threshold Range

5. How would you modify your loop to evaluate acolinearity thresholds from 80 to 200 ?
