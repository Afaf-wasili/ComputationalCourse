/*
Write a C++ program that uses a CLASS and a HEADER file:

1) Create a header file named Particle.h that:
   - defines a class called Particle
   - contains private data members:
       name (string)
       mass (double)
   - declares public member functions:
       setData(name, mass)
       printData()

2) Create a main.cpp file that:
   - includes "Particle.h"
   - creates an object of the Particle class
   - sets the particle name and mass
   - prints the particle information

Make sure the class definition is written in the header file.
