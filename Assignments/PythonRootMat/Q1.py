1. Plot the massPion and massKaon histograms on the same canvas, including a legend (using either uproot with matplotlib or ROOT).
2. Compute the ratio of the two histograms and display it in a second pad (using either uproot with matplotlib or ROOT).
3. Fit one of the histograms (for example, massPion) with a Gaussian function (using either uproot with matplotlib or ROOT).
4. Add the full style, such as title for the axes, legend, etc.  
Optionally, you can create three pads within the same code; however, keep in mind that ROOT must be used separately, as you cannot interact between uproot with matplotlib and ROOT.
